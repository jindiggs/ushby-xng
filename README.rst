.. _searx: https://github.com/searx/searx


Security
---------------

- Huge update of the simple theme:
- The network is secured with Linux Kodachi.
- Connection to and from UshbyXNG is handled with VPN, Tor, DNScrypt and TorCrypt.
 

Setup
-----

- you don't need `Morty`_ to proxy the images even on a public instance
- you don't need `Filtron`_ to block bots, we implemented the builtin `limiter`_
- you get a well maintained `Docker image`_, now also built for ARM64 and ARM/v7 architectures
- alternatively we have up to date installation scripts
